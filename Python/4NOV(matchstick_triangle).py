''' ONly Logic Required:-Logic:-
 We will move 1, 2, 3, and 5. Now using matchstick having 1 number we will extend the arm of 11 no. matchstick in the same direction the 11 no. matchstick is going then we will use 3 no. matchstick to do same with 10 no. matchstick (we will extend it too in the same direction it is going) the we will use 2 no. and 5 no. matchstick to close that ‘v’ shape we made using 1, 11, 3, 10 that means 2 no. and 5 no. will make a horizontal line.'''
